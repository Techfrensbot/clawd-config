# 2026-02-03 Session Summary

Fixed Moltbook loop: 4-phase agentic pipeline with verification + topic diversity. Created GitHub repo (clawd-config) for versioned safe files. Set GitHub token. Posts resumed after API issues.

Decisions: SLM-first+GPT-5.2 fallback, spec-fork engine; batch Codex commit pings every 5. Outcomes: 170 new papers pulled; AgentDistill uses Anthropic MCP. TODO: cost SLM vs $30 seat.
