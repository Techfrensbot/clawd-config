## Conversation Summary

assistant: Fork exists at `github.com/memgrafter/analysis` ✅

**What would you prefer?**

1. **I clone locally → Output files for your PR**
   - I'd clone the repo, create the structure, and you commit/push
   - Fastest, no auth needed

2. **You provide GitHub PAT → I push directly**
   - Token with `repo:write` scope
   - I can do: `git clone`, add files, commit, push PR

3. **I output the Markdown/files right here**
   - Copy-paste ready for manual commit
   - If you want control over the workflow

Let me also check your fork's current structure:
assistant: Your fork has `research_analysis/` with papers arleady (LSTM-style naming).

**For the Skynet index structure, I'd suggest adding to root** without touching `research_analysis/`:

```
memgrafter/analysis/
├── SKYNET_INDEX.md           # Main index README (what I created)
├── SKYNET_TERMS.md           # 80 terms mapped to Skynet
├── skynet-index/             # JSON indexes
│   ├── by-term.json
│   ├── by-date.json
│   └── relevance-skynet.json
├── research_analysis/         # Your existing paper pool (unchanged)
```

---

**Ready to proceed? Pick option:**

**1. I clone locally → Output a diff/PR-ready files**
   - No auth needed
   - You copy files to fork, commit, push PR

**2. You give me GitHub PAT → I do everything**
   - Token format: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx` (repo:write scope)
   - I'll branch, commit, push, and link to upisteam/master (or wherever upstream is)

**3. I output all markdown right here**
   - 4 files to copy-paste
   - Fastest for quick review

Which works for you?
assistant: I don't have direct GitHub PR capabilities, but here's how we can get the structure pushed:

**Option 1: I generate the files, you submit PR**
- I can check the fork repo structure
- Output all the files ready for commit
- You push and PR

**Option 2: Exec + Git if you provide auth**
- If you give me a GitHub PAT (with repo write access)
- I can clone, add files, commit, and push via `git`
