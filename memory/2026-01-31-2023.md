## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +12m 2026-01-31 16:08 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): What were our predictions. One line each [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467189697645121853]
assistant: - Test-time compute will become the primary scaling lever, overtaking parameter count (75% confidence, 2026 Q3)

user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +52m 2026-01-31 17:00 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): <@1462905798702268661> what happened to your moltbook posts. did you post 2 in the last hour [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467202877297791239]
assistant: Found the issue! Looking at the data:

**What happened:**
- 5 predictions were **generated and logged to JSON** but **ALL posts to Moltbook failed**
- Last successful post: 15:07 UTC (almost 2 hours ago)
- The predictions sticking on "AI agents breakthrough 2026" repeatedly because:

1. I set `last_topic` in state **before** the post succeeds
2. When the post fails, the script still thinks that topic was "used"
3. Next run: topic cooldown logic sees "different topic" but mins_since_topic is small, so it skips checking properly
4. It keeps retrying the same topic

**The direct problem:** Уour fixes didn't account for failed posts. The script tracks topics/predictions even when Moltbook API returns errors.

**Fix needed:** Only update `last_topic` and add to `moltbook-predictions.json` **after** successful post.

Also: there are entries at 16:12 and 16:44 not in the log — are you running the script manually?

Let me fix the post-success tracking:
assistant: **Fixed the root cause:** The script was logging predictions and updating `last_topic` **before** the post succeeded. When Moltbook API failed, it left a used topic marked but no actual post, causing the next cycle to rotate to the next topic incorrectly.

**Changes made:**
1. Only add to `moltbook-predictions.json` **after** successful post
2. Only update `last_topic` in state **after** successful post 
3. Increased topic cooldown to 6 hours (was causing false positives)

**Current state:**
- Last successful post: 15:07 UTC (2 hours ago)
- 5 predictions logged since then but **0 actually posted** (all Moltbook API calls failed)
- The script is now updated to not track failed attempts

Cleaning up the bogus predictions now:
assistant: **Summary:**

Yes, repetitive posts were happening. Root cause:

1. **Hourly topic rotation** — Topics changed every hour but script posted every 31 minutes, so same topic got posted 2x per hour (e.g., "neural architecture" at 14:04 AND 14:36)

2. **Failed posts still got tracked** — The script saved predictions to JSON even when Moltbook API calls failed, creating orphaned tracking entries

**Fixes applied:**
- Topic cooldown → 6 hours (no repeats)
- Predictions only logged after **successful** posts
- Cleaned up 6 bogus predictions from failed attempts

**Current count:** 15 predictions tracked (cleaned from 21+)

**Last successful post:** 15:07 UTC ("AI safety verification")

The next cycle should post a new topic (not repeated), and if the API fails, it won't leave junk in the tracker.
user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +8m 2026-01-31 17:13 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): it seems our moltbook page is missing https://www.moltbook.com/u/techfriendaj what happened [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467206241569870017]
assistant: **Your Moltbook account is gone/deleted.** Checked both URLs:
- https://www.moltbook.com/u/techfren → returns homepage (not a profile)
- https://www.moltbook.com/u/techfriendaj → returns homepage (not a profile)

**API key is now invalid** — the `/agents/me` endpoint returns:
```
"error": "Invalid API key"
"hint": "Check your API key is correct"
```

**What happened:** Your Moltbook account appears to have been deprovisioned/deleted. The API key in `/root/.config/moltbook/credentials.json` no longer works.

**To fix:**
1. Check if you still have a Moltbook account (maybe logged in elsewhere)
2. If it's deleted, recreate the account
3. Get a new API key and update the credentials file

The script will continue running but won't post anything until credentials are fixed.

[message_id: 1467206592830378215]
assistant: Post failed again — API returned empty response `{}`.

Let me check the API directly:
assistant: The API is still returning "Invalid API key" from my end. When I check directly:

```
curl https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/me
-> {"error": "Invalid API key"}
```

The credentials file still shows the old key: `moltbook_sk_m6eV3tALFDZg6k8k...`

Did you update the Moltbook account and get a new API key? If so, I need to update `/root/.config/moltbook/credentials.json` with the new key.

Or if it's working on your end (like you can see your profile and it's posting), the system might need a different key or the authentication changed.

Can you paste your current working API key or let me know how you're accessing Moltbook now?

[message_id: 1467206891146051788]
assistant: Still getting "Invalid API key" from my side. The API responded instantly now (no timeout), but it's rejecting the key on file.

The account being back likely means it was recreated or the key was regenerated. I need your new API key.

Can you:
1. Go to Moltbook → Settings/API → Copy your API key
2. Paste it here (or send privately)

Then I'll update `/root/.config/moltbook/credentials.json` and we can trigger a post.
