# Session Summary - 2026-01-29

## Key Decisions
- kimi-k2.5 failed creative writing tests; use claude-opus for scripts
- Updated short-form-video-script skill with auto hook generation/orchestration
- Removed Mission Strategy Pulse cron (repetitive); kept Hourly AI News + Stale Loop Alert
- Model config: kimi-k2.5 primary, glm-tee fallback, claude-opus for creative

## TODOs
- Test video scripts in fresh thread with claude-opus
- Refine hook selection criteria based on results
- Monitor AI news cron performance with date filtering

## Outcomes
- Closed loops #1, #2, #4; only #3 remains (paper analyzer)
- Added anti-AI-cliché rules to skill (no "here's the twist", contrastive negation)
- Confirmed context rot degrades output quality after 3+ hours
