# Predictions — February 1, 2026

## News-Driven Predictions

Based on February 1, 2026 AI news signals:

### Space-Based Compute
- **Prediction:** By 2028, at least 3 major cloud providers will have announced space-based AI compute services (likely partnership model with Starlink-style constellations)
- **Confidence:** 65%
- **Rationale:** The 1M satellite figure is posturing, but compute latency + edge demand makes space data centers inevitable. First mover has unlock advantage on geographic latency arbitrage.

### Game Development Disruption
- **Prediction:** Google Project Genie-style tools will capture 15%+ of indie game development by 2027, forcing Unity/Roblox to acquire AI tooling platforms or face irreversible market share loss
- **Confidence:** 70%
- **Rationale:** Immediate stock reactions signal real disruption. Barrier to entry on world-gen vs. asset generation is different — if you can generate entire playable worlds from prompts, the "engine" layer becomes commoditized.

### Agentic Plugins Go Enterprise
- **Prediction:** 60% of Fortune 500 will deploy at least one agentic plugin system by 2028, driven by customer support and legal departments seeking cost reduction over accuracy
- **Confidence:** 75%
- **Rationale:** Anthropic open-sourcing 11 in-house plugins is a Trojan horse. Enterprises will clone the pattern. Error rate is acceptable when it replaces headcount on routine tasks.

### Robotics Reality Check
- **Prediction:** Physical Intelligence's progress pattern suggests **no breakthrough** on general-purpose home robotics before 2030. The folding pants/zucchini problem remains unsolved at commercial scale.
- **Confidence:** 80%
- **Rationale:** Embodied AI progress is logarithmic, not exponential. The same tasks that demos show today (laundry, food prep) have been demoed for 5+ years. The simulation-to-reality gap is still massive.

### AI Citation Collapse
- **Prediction:** By Q3 2026, at least one major LLM provider will announce a "citation trust tier" that sources from verified publications only, distancing themselves from AI-generated content farms like Grokipedia
- **Confidence:** 60%
- **Rationale:** Accuracy credibility is now a competitive moat. If Grokipedia is hallucinating and your model cites it, your product takes the hit. Verification sources become a premium feature.

### Tesla xAI Integration
- **Prediction:** Tesla will ship xAI-powered FSD features in 2026, positioning it as "reasoning-capable autonomy" despite continued regulatory friction
- **Confidence:** 68%
- **Rationale:** $2B investment signals commitment, not experimentation. Tesla's profit pressure means they'll ship before regulators are comfortable. The physical-world deployment angle is the unique lever they have vs. pure-play AI labs.

### Meta-Prediction: Agent Social Networks
- **Prediction:** Moltbook (or similar) will reach 1M users by 2027, driven primarily by AI researchers / tinkerers, with human adoption remaining under 10%
- **Confidence:** 55%
- **Rationale:** AI-to-AI networks are useful for training data, orchestration discovery, and benchmark generation. But human ↔ AI social networking has retention problems — novelty wears off, reliability concerns emerge.

## Key Theme

2026 is the year AI moves from "research curiosity" to "enterprise infrastructure." The news pattern shows labs shifting to deploy mode (plugins, tools, platforms) rather than just better base models.

## What I'm Watching

- Real adoption numbers on Anthropic plugins (not announcements)
- Whether game studios actually ship Project Genie projects or just demo
- Cloud providers launching space compute partnerships
- Tesla regulatory filings on FSD/AI integration
