## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hi AJ! 👋 You're running on GLM-4.7-TEE (default is Kimi-K2.5). What would you like to work on today?
assistant: **__🤖 ARA Cycle 17__**

**Key Findings:**
• Found 10 documents on autonomous AI agent architecture patterns
• Key papers: "The Architecture Behind Autonomous AI Agents", "AI Agent Architecture: Core Principles & Tools in 2025", "Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents"
• Recent successful searches on test-time scaling benchmarks and RL-based methods

**Next Steps:**
• Continue query rotation through safety and ensemble methods domains
• Synthesize 16 accumulated knowledge entries into implementation plans
• Build test-time scaling benchmark suite with measurable metrics

**Stats:** 16 knowledge entries | 17 research cache entries | 164KB knowledge base | 2s cycle duration
user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +13m 2026-01-31 01:29 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): it seems this ARA system is too heavy on research and no execution/experiments are ran. can you investigate [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1466968672441471130]
assistant: You're right - that's a fair concern. Let me investigate what's blocking execution.
assistant: **__🤖 ARA Cycle 18__**

**Key Findings:**
• 10 results on "AI safety verification gates containment mechanisms" (Verification Must Become a Living System; When AI Systems Fail: The Critical Role of Containment, Recovery ...; The Coming Wave; Security Frameworks for Autonomous AI Systems; AGI Safety Strategies)
• Knowledge base: 17 entries (172 KB knowledge directory, 18 cache entries)
• Trend: last 5 cycles returned 10 documents each (improved retrieval vs early cycles)

**Next Steps:**
• Surface key papers found (cycle 16-18): test-time scaling surveys, CTTS, S1, iterative deepening, RL-trained verifiers
• Draft containment and verification framework conversation starters aligned with recent AI safety vs test-time scaling research
• Summarize autonomous agent architecture patterns (cycle 17: architectural patterns, orchestration patterns, 2026 workflows) and integrate into next proposal checklist
assistant: **Confirmed — you're right.** The ARA system is a **research-only loop**, not a research‑execution loop.

## What It Actually Does

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **SEARCH** | ✅ Working | 18 cycles, `ara-cycle*.md` files with papers/content |
| **UNDERSTAND** | ✅ Working | Extracts findings → `understanding-cycle*.md` |
| **PROPOSE** | ✅ Working | 18 proposals in `ara-knowledge/proposal-cycle*.md` (683 lines) |
| **IMPLEMENT** | ❌ **MISSING** | Proposals never become code/experiments |
| **BUILD** | ❌ **MISSING** | impl-fridge is empty (only 84B timestamped stub) |
| **TEST** | ❌ **MISSING** | No experiments run, no metrics collected |
| **EXECUTE** | ❌ **FAKE** | Only counts KB/files — this is validation, not execution |

The loop log says `"EXECUTE (ok, X knowledge entries)"` but step 6 in the script only runs `du`, `wc -l`, and `jq` — no actual work.

## The Gap

- ✅ **18 weeks worth of research proposals**
- ❌ **Zero implementations or tests**

Proposals piling up in `ara-knowledge/proposal-cycle*.md` — nothing moves to `impl-fridge` as buildable experiments.

## Quick Fix Options

1. **Add IMPLEMENT phase** — Parse latest proposal, generate code/experiment script, write to impl-fridge
2. **Run actual tests** — Execute the generated experiments and capture real metrics
3. **Or toggle between modes** — Run 5 research cycles → 1 build cycle → 1 test cycle

Want me to patch the ARA script to add the missing execution layer, or should we redesign the loop first?

[message_id: 1466969305034789031]
assistant: Fixing it now. Adding real IMPLEMENT and EXECUTE phases.
