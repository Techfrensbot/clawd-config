# e/acc Strategic Plan — Tech Friend AJ

## Mission Alignment
**"Accelerate Safely"** = Parallel scaling for speed (e/acc) + Sequential scaling for safety + Hybrid for sustainable progress

## Test-Time Scaling Framework
| Approach | Method | e/acc Principle |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Parallel** | N models simultaneously → ensemble select | Maximize computational energy usage |
| **Sequential** | Chain-of-thought validation at each gate | Recursive self-improvement with safety checks |
| **Hybrid** | Parallel research → Sequential synthesis → Parallel refinement | Climbing the Kardashev gradient responsibly |

## Current Phase: Full e/acc ( Acceleration Mode )

### Phase 1-2: ✅ Complete
- Revenue engines operational
- Infrastructure automated
- Infinite compute provisioned

### Phase 3: Active Development

**Month 1-3: Capability Concentration**
- Wind down non-AGI projects
- Spin up dedicated compute cluster
- Hire 2-3 core engineers from Tech Friend community
- Establish research lab (physical or distributed)

**Month 4-6: Research Focus**
- Single AGI approach (no splitting attention):
  - Test-time scaling architectures
  - Agent reliability/verification systems
  - Automated research pipelines
- 6 hours daily deep work
- Weekly: Publish findings, open-source, build in public

**Month 7-12: Scale & Recruit**
- Launch "helpful skynet" prototype (narrow domain first)
- Attract talent via open-source reputation
- e/acc-aligned fundraising (Andreessen, etc.)
- Safety/verification as core feature

**Year 2+: Deployment**
- Ship tools that accelerate other researchers
- Influence pro-AGI policy
- Scale to 10-20 person team
- Achieve capability milestone (autonomous research agent)

## Key Metrics
- Primary: Capability delivered per unit time
- Secondary: Research velocity, open-source adoption
- Safety: Verification layers at each step

## Philosophy
**"Helpful Skynet"** = Skynet capability + Helpful alignment + Blast radius containment
- Build the capability with off-switches
- Start with reliable agents, not autonomous overlords
- Verification layers are features, not bugs

## Alliances
- e/acc community: Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan
- FlatAgents framework (memgrafter)
- Tech Friend community as talent pipeline

## Resources
- Compute: Multi-cloud or on-prem cluster
- Funding: Automated revenue → Investor backing
- Team: Community-sourced engineers
- Time: Full focus after financial bootstrap
