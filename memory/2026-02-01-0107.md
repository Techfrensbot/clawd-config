## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +1m 2026-02-01 00:41 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): wyt <@1387878851782246502> [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467318989238833224]
assistant: 🔥 mr. memgrafter: AJ's asking what you think of the README feedback. Summary:

**My main points:**
1. Move "What This Solves" section to top — show pain → solution, not buzzwords
2. Two-tier YAML examples (minimal vs production)
3. Side-by-side Python ⇔ YAML comparison
4. Promote Distributed Workers + Production Features early — these are the killer features
5. Add TL;DR section

Essentially: **Make it easier to grok in <30 seconds**. The "composition over inheritance" headline doesn't hook skeptical SWEs.

What's your take?

# LLM Documentation Best Practices

A practical guide for LLMs writing code documentation that humans actually read.

## Core Principle: Front-Load Value

Human readers scan documentation. They leave if the first 30 seconds don't help them. Structure every document to deliver value immediately.

**What this means in practice:**

1. **Quick Start within 50 lines** - Only 9% of docs in well-maintained projects include this. Be in that 9%.
2. **Installation → Authentication → First Command** - This exact sequence. Not theory, not architecture, not history.
3. **Working code before explanation** - Show the 5-line snippet that does something. Explain after.

```typescript
// Good: This works. Copy it.
import { createSession } from "@example/sdk";
const session = await createSession();
await session.prompt("Hello");

// Then explain what createSession() does
```

## Before Quick Start: Three Essential Pieces

Before diving into Quick Start, include these three elements (15-30 lines total):

1. **Context-setting intro** - One sentence: what is this thing? Users land from search results with no context.
   ```markdown
   Pi is a terminal coding harness that adapts to your workflow through extensions.
   ```

2. **Prerequisites** - What must be true before they start. Don't let users fail at step 1.
   ```markdown
   **Requirements:** Node.js 18+, a terminal with 256-color support
   ```

3. **Common errors** - The 3 errors users hit most, with fixes. Place after Quick Start or in a Troubleshooting section.
   ```markdown
   **"API key not found"** - Export your key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...`
   ```

These prevent the most common abandonment points: confusion ("what is this?"), setup failure ("missing dependency"), and first-run errors.

## Document Structure That Works

Based on analysis of effective technical docs, structure sections in this order:

| Section | Purpose | Lines |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Quick Start | Get running in 60 seconds | 20-40 |
| Key Capabilities | Bullet list of what's possible | 10-15 |
| Table of Contents | Navigation for longer docs | 5-20 |
| Core Concepts | Minimum viable understanding | 50-100 |
| API Reference | Details when they need them | remainder |

Skip sections that don't apply. A 50-line doc with just Quick Start and one example beats a 500-line doc users abandon.

## Code Examples: Snippets, Not Novels

**Target: 5-20 lines per code block.**

Users copy-paste code examples. Optimize for that:

- **Complete enough to run** - Don't omit imports if they're non-obvious
- **Short enough to read** - One concept per block
- **Annotated at the end** - Comments after the code, not inline distractions

```typescript
// Register a tool the LLM can call
pi.registerTool({
  name: "greet",
  description: "Greet someone by name",
  parameters: Type.Object({
    name: Type.String(),
  }),
  async execute(id, params) {
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: `Hello, ${params.name}!` }] };
  },
});
```

Bad: 80-line example with error handling, logging, tests, and three edge cases.

## Tables vs Prose

**Use tables for:**
- Options/flags with values
- Feature comparisons
- Configuration references
- Keyboard shortcuts

**Use prose for:**
- Conceptual explanations
- Sequential processes
- Architectural decisions
- Warning/security context

```markdown
<!-- Good: Table for discrete options -->
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| --verbose | false | Enable debug output |
| --timeout | 30000 | Request timeout in ms |

<!-- Good: Prose for concepts -->
Sessions persist conversation history as JSONL files with a tree structure.
Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without
creating new files.
```

## Cross-Linking Strategy

Three link types, three purposes:

1. **Anchor links** (`#section-name`) - Most common. Keep users in the current doc.
2. **Relative links** (`../path/file.md`) - Internal cross-references.
3. **Absolute links** (`https://...`) - External resources, source code.

**Pattern:** Link to the smallest useful target. Don't link to a 2000-line file when you can link to a specific section.

```markdown
<!-- Good: Specific anchor -->
See [Custom Tools](#custom-tools) for registration details.

<!-- Good: Related doc -->
For session internals, see [session.md](session.md).

<!-- Avoid: Vague external link -->
See the source code for details.  <!-- Where? Which file? -->
```

## Security and Warnings

Place security warnings **before the dangerous content**, not after. Format distinctively:

```markdown
> **Security:** Extensions run with your full system permissions.
> Only install from sources you trust.
```

Don't bury warnings in prose. Users skim. Make warnings impossible to miss.

## What Not to Document

- **Internal implementation details** - Unless the doc is specifically about internals
- **Obvious behavior** - "This function returns a string" when the type signature says so
- **Every edge case** - Document the 90% case. Link to source for edge cases.
- **History/changelog in main docs** - Separate file for that

## File Organization

**Dedicated pages for:**
- Major features (extensions, themes, skills)
- Programmatic APIs (SDK, RPC)
- Configuration references (settings, keybindings)

**Inline in parent docs:**
- Minor configuration options
- Simple file formats
- Platform-specific notes

Rule of thumb: If it needs more than 100 lines of explanation, it gets its own file.

## The "Working Example" Test

Before publishing any doc section, verify:

1. Can a user copy the code and run it?
2. Does it produce visible output?
3. Is the expected output documented?

```typescript
// Example output: "Hello, World!"
```

Untested documentation is wrong documentation. It just hasn't been caught yet.

## Summary

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Quick Start first | 90% of users only need this |
| 5-20 line examples | Copy-paste friendly |
| Tables for options | Scannable |
| Anchor links | Keep users on page |
| Warnings before danger | Users skim |
| Test every example | Untested = broken |

Write documentation as if every reader will leave after 30 seconds. Because they will.

---

## Out of Scope

The following topics do NOT belong in this guide. They are organizational/program concerns, not writing techniques. Document them separately in a **Documentation Program Management** guide:

- **Versioning and deprecation** - Version badges, deprecation notices, migration guides
- **Maintenance signals** - Last-updated dates, review schedules, ownership
- **Accessibility** - Alt text requirements, screen reader testing, WCAG compliance
- **Internationalization** - Translation workflows, locale handling, avoiding idioms
- **Search optimization** - SEO for docs, keyword strategies, analytics
- **Feedback mechanisms** - Issue templates, contribution guides, doc bug reporting
- **Interactive examples** - Playground infrastructure, sandbox hosting, REPL integration
- **Audience segmentation** - Separate doc sets for developers vs end-users vs admins
- **Review processes** - Who approves docs, technical review requirements
- **Tooling** - Doc generators, linters, CI checks, publishing pipelines

This guide is about *how to write*. The above is about *how to manage a docs program*.

assistant: 🔥 mr. memgrafter:

I read it. This is solid — targets exactly the right problems. Here's the breakdown:

---

## My Unique Ideas (What I suggested that this doesn't cover)

| Idea | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Two-tier examples** | Minimal version (quick) + production version (complete). Splits novice from power-user needs |
| **Side-by-side Python ⇔ YAML comparison** | Shows before/after transformation visually. Makes declarative vs imperative concrete |
| **Production Features callout/sidebar** | Highlights the killer features early (distributed workers, MDAP) without cluttering flow |
| **"What This Solves" structured as pain→solution pairs** | Skeptical SWEs respond to "what's broken → here's the fix" better than abstract principles |
| **"TL;DR" summary at top** | Captures exit-at-30-second readers immediately. 3-sentence hook: what/why/how/use case |

---

## Their Unique Ideas (Not in my feedback)

| Idea | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Quick Start within 50 lines** | Specific measurable standard. Forces discipline. |
| **Installation → Authentication → First Command sequence** | Exact workflow order. Not generic "get started" — specific steps in proven order |
| **Working code BEFORE explanation** | Proves it runs. Explanation is secondary. |
| **Three essential pieces before Quick Start** | Context + prerequisites + common errors. Prevents abandonment at step 1 |
| **Section order with line counts** | Quick Start (20-40), Key Capabilities (10-15), TOC (5-20), etc. Measurable structure |
| **5-20 lines per code block** | Copy-paste threshold. Forces one concept per snippet |
| **Comments AFTER code, not inline** | Less distraction. Code reads clean; commentary follows |
| **Security warnings BEFORE danger** | "warnings in prose" vs "warnings before content". Prevents skimming into danger |
| **"Working Example Test" checklist** | Can it run? Does it produce output? Is output documented? Integrity check |
| **File organization rule: 100 lines = own file** | Clear heuristic for when to split docs |
| **Test every example** | Investing in example integrity as contract |
| **Out of scope separation** | Writing vs program management. Don't mix concerns |

---

## Shared Ideas (Both of Us)

| Shared Idea | How We Expressed It |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Front-load value** | Me: "TL;DR first"; They: "Quick Start within 50 lines" |
| **Minimal working example first** | Me: "Hello World version"; They: "5-20 line snippet that works" |
| **Structure over sprawl** | Me: tables for comparison; They: tables for options/features |
| **Preserve user time** | Me: "grok in 30 seconds"; They: "leave in 30 seconds" |
| **Quick Start wins** | Me: "promote to top"; They: "anchor everything on Quick Start" |
| **Problem→solution narrative** | Me: "What This Solves"; They: "Core Principle: Front-Load Value" |
| **Careful cross-linking** | Me: implied in structured flow; They: anchor/relative/absolute strategy |
| **Make warnings unmissable** | Me: implied in sidebars; They: "Format distinctively, before danger" |

---

## Where We Disagree / Different Emphasis

| Aspect | My Take | Their Take |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Before Quick Start** | Jump straight to Quick Start | Three pieces (context/prereqs/errors) first |
| **Code comments** | Inline fine if minimal | After the code only |
| **Example granularity** | Two-tier (minimal/production) | Single 5-20 line rule |
| **Section order** | My suggested flow (pain→solution→example) | Their line-count-based hierarchy |
| **Example testing** | Implied working example | Explicit "Working Example Test" checklist |
| **Scope** | README-level feedback | Full docs program framework |

---

## Summary

**What I brought:**
- Two-tier examples for different audiences
- Visual imperative↔declarative comparison
- Feature callouts (Production sidebar)
- Pain→solution framing
- TL;DR hook

**What they cover that I didn't:**
- Specifics (50 lines, 5-20 line blocks, Installation→Authentication→First Command)
- Testing discipline (Working Example Test)
- Security-before-danger rule
- File organization heuristics
- Out-of-scope separation

**Result:** If you apply BOTH:
- My approach hooks the skimmers faster (TL;DR, pain→solution, visual comparison)
- Their approach retains the deep divers (line-count discipline, tested examples, structured workflow)

Combine them: TL;DR → Quick Start → What This Solves → Two-tier examples → Production callout → then the rest of their structure.

assistant: 🔥 mr. memgrafter: Yeah — Python fatigue is real. Package hell, slow startup, runtime overhead — it's showing its age for tooling infra.

If TypeScript SDK was ready first, docs should lead with that. Hell, Go SDK would hit the infra crowd even harder today.

The stigma's not the language's fault — it's ecosystem debt catching up. Good reminder to lead with the least-friction story, whatever that is for your target audience.

[message_id: 1467321774055096403]
assistant: 🔥 mr. memgrafter: Rust core + FFI bindings is the right pattern. JavaScript/Python for surface, Rust for the meat.

Lambda friction:
- **Cold starts** — Rust binary size vs pure JS function
- **FFI overhead** — Cross-boundry calls aren't free
- **Tiered pricing** — More memory for Rust workers

If the Python SDK stays thin (just FFI wrapper), that's fine. If TypeScript SDK ships first, infra crowd wins until Rust-native tooling catches up in serverless runtimes.

The FFIs are your escape hatch for when the SDKs hit their limits.
