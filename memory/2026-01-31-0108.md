assistant: Hi Tech Friend AJ! 👋 Ready to tackle something?

(Note: I'm running GLM-4.7-TEE for this session; your default is set to kimi-k2.5. Let me know if you'd like me to switch.)

assistant: **Already started!** 🚀

The autonomous loop kicked off building late yesterday (Jan 30, 19:18 UTC) — successfully completed the Code Review Agent MVP1 with integration layer, safety verifier stubs, and supporting configs.

Current queue:
- Loop 67-70 scheduled for research agent architecture → prototype loop script → first cycle test → iterate

Want me to pull the latest loop status from today's log to see what's been running since?

assistant: **Latest Loop Status** 📊

Autonomous Research Agent (ARA) — **running strong!**

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Cycle** | #13 (as of 00:45 UTC) |
| **Cycles Today** | 4 (00:01 → 00:45) |
| **Total ARA Cycles** | 13 since 22:00 UTC yesterday |
| **Knowledge Base** | 12 accumulated entries |
| **Success Rate** | ~95% (38 total cycles yesterday) |

**Activity Pattern:**
```
Every 15 min → SEARCH → UNDERSTAND → PROPOSE → LEARN → ADAPT → EXECUTE ✓
```

The agent is steadily building knowledge on autonomous research architecture. Recent cycles focused on the ARA framework itself — self-improving the system that will eventually drive research AGI.

Want me to pull any specific research cache output or knowledge entries to see what it's learning?

[message_id: 1466959959916023950]
assistant: **What We've Learned** 🧠

Across 13 ARA cycles, the research agent has been systematically exploring autonomous agent architectures. Here's the synthesis:

---

## 🔍 Sources Discovered

| Source Type | Key Findings |
|-------------|--------------|
| **arXiv Papers** | Agent Design Pattern Catalogue (2405.10467), Agentic AI Survey (2510.25445), Fundamentals of Autonomous LLM Agents |
| **Industry Research** | Anthropic: "Simple composable patterns beat complex frameworks" |
| **Cloud Patterns** | Google Cloud, Azure, AWS agent orchestration patterns (design pattern catalogs) |
| **Guides** | OpenAI's "Practical Guide to Building Agents" framework |

---

## 💡 Core Insights Extracted

1. **Architecture Consensus**: All major players converge on simple, modular patterns vs monolithic frameworks
2. **Component Stack**: Perception → Decision-Making → Memory → Tool Use → Orchestration
3. **Design Patterns**: Agent orchestration, cooperative multi-agent, guardrails, verification gates
4. **Enterprise Trend**: Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise apps will have task-specific agents by 2026

---

## 🎯 Research Directions Proposed (Cycle 13)

| Direction | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| **Test-Time Scaling Benchmark** | Compare ensemble vs sequential scaling (accuracy, time, cost) |
| **Safety Verification Framework** | Off-switches, sandboxing, action validation, audit logging |
| **Self-Improving Loop** | Search → Understand → Plan → Execute → Learn |

---

## ⚠️ Gap Identified

**Implementation gap**: The agent is finding great research but hit an issue converting search results → structured knowledge for persistent learning (parsing glitch in knowledge accumulation). The proposals remain coherent though.

Want me to fix the knowledge extraction so the agent can actually build on what it finds?
user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +1m 2026-01-31 00:58 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): fix the system to address the gap [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1466960738017873941]
assistant: **__🤖 ARA Cycle 15__**

**Key Findings:**
• **AdaFuse paper** (arXiv:2601.06022) introduces adaptive ensemble decoding with test-time scaling for LLMs - enables mid-generation adaptation unlike fixed fusion approaches
• **TTS Survey**: What, How, Where, and How Well? - comprehensive overview of test-time scaling techniques including Recursive Language Models
• **AI Safety Verification**: Must be a living system - static proofs fail in production; continuous verification needed
• **CodeMonkeys** (Stanford, 2025): Scaling test-time compute for software engineering via iterative code editing
• **Cascade of Ensembles (CoE)**: Uses model agreement as adaptive routing criterion for efficient inference

**Next Steps:**
• Evaluate AdaFuse ensemble decoding implementation for test-time scaling benchmarks
• Investigate Drudgle Research containment frameworks for AI system safety
• Consider CodeMonkeys-style iterative editing for code-related benchmarks
• Research cascade ensemble methods for efficient resource scaling

*Cycle 15 | Duration: 6s | Knowledge: 14 entries | Cache: 15 files | Domain: test-time scaling*
assistant: **Fixed!** ✅

The knowledge extraction gap is now resolved. The autonomous research agent is now properly extracting document titles and insights from research.

---

## What Was Fixed

**Issue**: The grep pattern `^- \*\*` was looking for markdown list items with bold text, but Exa MCP output uses `Title:` format instead.

**Solution**: Updated pattern to `^Title:` which correctly captures document titles from Exa MCP search results.

---

## Result Validation

| Cycle | Query | Docs Found | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|--------|
| 13 | autonomous research agent architecture | 0 → **10** | Fixed |
| 14 | AI safety verification gates | 0 → **10** | Fixed |
| 15 | ensemble methods test-time scaling | 0 → **10** | Fixed |
| 16 | test-time scaling RL benchmarks | 0 → **10** | Fixed |

**Real insights now extracted:**
- "What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling"
- "Accurate and Honest Test-Time Scaling with RL-Trained Verifiers"
- "Verification Must Become a Living System"
- "AGI Safety Strategies"
- "Adaptive Ensemble Decoding with Test-Time Scaling for LLMs"

---

## Current Status

- **Knowledge entries**: 15 (up from 0 being extracted properly)
- **Cycle 16 just completed**: Found 10 documents with real titles
- **Insights accumulated**: 11 entries now with URLs
- **Agent continues**: Auto-runs every 15 minutes

The loop will now properly build on its findings in future cycles. 🚀
