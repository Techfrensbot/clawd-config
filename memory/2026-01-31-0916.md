## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: **__🤖 ARA Cycle 55__**

**Gap to Close:** Build actual test-time scaling benchmark (not mock)
**Gap Status:** closed

**Key Findings:**

Before we do you have one last chance to explain what value we got from them [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]

[message_id: 1467083933416947825]
assistant: Let me check what concrete artifacts actually exist versus what was logged.
assistant: ## Honest Assessment

**The ARA loops produced minimal actual value.**

Here's what actually exists:

### The One Substantial Artifact
- **`memory/impl-fridge/helpful-skynet/code-review-agent.md`** (8.9K, 258 lines)
  - Comprehensive research synthesis on test-time scaling + agent architecture
  - Architecture plan for code review safety system
  - This was created during a manual BUILD cycle (log shows `~12 min` duration)
  - **NOT** produced by the autonomous loop itself

### What the Loops Actually Did
- **55 cycles**, mostly rotating through the same 4 search queries
- Found the same papers repeatedly without synthesizing new insights
- Generated ~14K lines of JSON state showing the same gaps being "closed" repeatedly
- Most "implementations_built" entries are just empty `details` fields

### Evidence of Low Value
From ara/state.json:
- `gaps_closed`: the same gap logged 7 times
- `proposed_directions`: mostly just "Proposal X" with no content
- `knowledge_entries`: mostly search result dumps, not synthesized insight
- Research cache: 820K of raw dumps, majority are stub files (50 bytes)

The loops essentially logged that they were "doing work" without producing anything new or usable beyond the initial manual research cycle.

---

**My recommendation: Cleanse the ARA artifacts.** Keep code-review-agent.md if it's useful for your Helpful Skynet work, but drop the loops, state files, and research cache.

Want me to proceed with the cleanup?
user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +1m 2026-01-31 09:10 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): Delete all artifacts and cron jobs etc related to the ara loops [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467084691223085161]
assistant: ARA artifacts completely removed. Summary:

## ✅ Deleted

**Cron Job:**
- `Autonomous Loop v4` (15-min ARA loop) — REMOVED

**Files (~944K total):**
- `/root/clawd/memory/ara-state.json`
- `/root/clawd/memory/ara-knowledge.md`
- `/root/clawd/memory/ara-log-*.md`
- `/root/clawd/memory/research-cache/` (820K)

- `/root/clawd/scripts/autonomous-loop-v*.sh`
- `/root/clawd/scripts/loop-tracker.sh`
- `/root/clawd/memory/ara-*` directories

**Updated:**
- `/root/clawd/memory/active-focus.md` — now Moltbook-only focus
- `/root/clawd/HEARTBEAT.md` — removed ARA references

## Remaining Cron Jobs
- Moltbook Engagement Loop (31-min)
- Hourly AI News
- Daily AI News for sweet_potet
- Stale Loop Alert
- Daily AI News

Housekeeping references remain in daily log files (2026-01-30-2033.md, etc.) — those are historical records.
user: [Discord Guild #frenbot channel id:1463626793801089191 +53s 2026-01-31 09:14 UTC] Tech Friend AJ (techfren): we can also delete stale loop alert why is there two daily news? [from: Tech Friend AJ (200272755520700416)]
[message_id: 1467085625260900517]
assistant: Stale Loop Alert deleted.

For the two news jobs:

1. **Hourly AI News** - Runs every hour, tags you + Jesse, dedup filtered
2. **Daily AI News** - Runs daily at midnight, same basic function

The Daily AI News job appears redundant since you have the Hourly one. Want me to delete it too?
