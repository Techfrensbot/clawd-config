## Technical Accomplishments

**Pocket TTS Integration**
- Revanth_12 deployed Pocket TTS API at http://216.9.224.204:8000
- API key: sk-pocket-8x7Kd2Pq9WmN5vLcR3tY6zFjH4bG1aE0
- Successfully discovered correct API format through automated testing
- Created working Python script: `/root/clawd/scripts/pocket_tts_enhanced.py`
- Test audio generated: `/root/tts_output/tts_20260122_052425.wav` (193KB)
- Found working endpoint: http://216.9.224.204:8000/tts (form data format)

**Discord Skills Research**
- Researched and installed discord v1.0.1 and discord-doctor v1.0.0 skills
- Discord skill capabilities: full control, message management, reactions, polls, media
- Discord-doctor capabilities: gateway checks, OAuth validation, auto-fix, cleanup
- Available for Tech Friend Community integration

**Model Testing**
- Multiple model switches performed for performance evaluation
- Started: GLM 4.7 → haiku → GLM 4.5 flash → GLM 4.7 → gpt-5.1-codex-mini → GLM 4.7 → gpt-5.1-codex-mini → GLM 4.5 flash
- Current model: GLM 4.5 flash (05:14:05 UTC)

## Technical Issues

**Codex CLI Integration**
- Clawdbot's `readCodexCliCredentials` function doesn't extract `account_id`
- Only reads access_token, refresh_token, and calculates expires
- AJ submitted PR to fix this issue

**Discord Media Upload**
- Discord skill supports media handling, but file upload through message interface not working
- Audio files available on server but need alternative upload methods

## Configuration Changes

**Discord Channel Settings**
- `requireMention` changed to false (responds to all messages)
- Allow increased engagement for testing and community interaction

## Community Activity

**Jailbreak Testing**
- Continued security testing from previous days
- Dynamic interaction between peasantry1833, Revanth_12, AJ, and Dr. vova
- Multiple approaches to testing boundaries

**User Preferences**
- peasantry1833 prefers to be called "peas" instead of full username
- Preference documented for future interactions
