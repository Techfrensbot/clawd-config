System: [2026-01-31 05:02:33 UTC] Cron: Now I can filter the results. Let me identify new stories from today (PT Jan 30, 2026):

**New articles found:**
1. **Dow cuts 4,500 jobs, shifting emphasis to AI and automation** (Jan 30, 2026) - CBS News
2. **UK launches state's first Bachelor of Science in AI** (Jan 29, 2026) - UKNow

The PepsiCo and news business articles are already in history. Let me fix the corrupted JSON file and add the new stories:

System: [2026-01-31 05:30:55 UTC] Loop: **🤖 ARA Cycle 40**

**Key Findings:**
• Cycle 40 Query: "test-time scaling reinforcement learning experiments benchmarks"
• Test-time scaling benchmark: ensemble ~3x slower vs sequential (62.48ms vs 19.93ms avg), slight accuracy +3% (0.843 vs 0.812)
• Safety verification gate active: 2 allowed, 1 blocked in this run
• Knowledge base: 38 entries across 4 research domains (test-time scaling, ensemble methods, AI safety, agent architecture)

**Experiment Stats:**
• Experiments run this cycle: benchmark + safety verification (both executed)
• Cumulative: 21 experiments executed, 7 implementations built

**Next Steps:**
• Refine execution cost accounting: attach safety usage directly to test-time compute budget and model ensemble count rather than documents
• Explore adaptive ensemble sizing: average accuracy gain ≈3% for a 3× inference slowdown — evaluate larger ensembles under budgeted compute
• Escalate strongest ensemble findings to SANDBOX trial builds in /root/clawd/benches (MCP or direct spawn) and update /root/clawd/memory/loop-log-2026-01-31.md and loop-performance.json
• Consider query set expansion: add "inference-time scaling vs retrieval-augmented generation", "dynamic pruning at inference", "batch size scaling for safety gates"
