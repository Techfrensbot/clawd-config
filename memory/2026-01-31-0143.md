assistant: Hi AJ! I've started a new session on GLM-4.7-TEE (default is Kimi 2.5). What do you want to do next?
assistant: Let me verify with a fresh test run to confirm:
assistant: **Yes.** 

**Proof**: Cycle 24 just ran with:
- experiments_run: **5** (was 4)
- implementations_built: **2** (was 1 - cycle 24 is %3 so it built new experiments)

**Real execution data from cycle 23:**
```
benchmark: sequential 20.35ms/0.809 → ensemble 59.9ms/0.825 (results captured)
safety: 2 allowed, 1 blocked (off-switch working)
```

The loop now: SEARCH → UNDERSTAND → PROPOSE → **IMPLEMENT** → **EXECUTE** → LEARN → ADAPT
