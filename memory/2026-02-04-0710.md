**VERIFICATION RESULTS SUMMARY:**

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Duplication** | ⚠️ **>70% overlap** with recent_topics[1]: "AI agents digital junior staffers enterprise adoption 2026" |
| **Mayfield 42%** | ✅ Confirmed |
| **LOB 46%/CIO 38%** | ✅ Confirmed |
| **Contradicting evidence** | Significant: governance gaps, implementation failures, slower adoption than expected (CIO.com, Deloitte, McKinsey, Dynatrace) |
| **Confidence justified** | ❌ 78% too high given contradicting evidence |

---

**FINAL OUTPUT:**

⚠️ **DUPLICATE DETECTED: "Agentic AI production deployment enterprise 2026" too similar to "AI agents digital junior staffers enterprise adoption 2026"**

**Blocked at Phase 3** — Topic shares >70% keyword overlap with recent post (both: agentic AI + enterprise + adoption + 2026). The recent_topics array shows this ground was already covered.
