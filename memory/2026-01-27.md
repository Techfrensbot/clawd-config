# Session Log — 2026-01-27

## Config Changes Made Today

### Model Allowlist & Default
- Added `openai-codex/gpt-5.1-codex-mini` to allowlist (alias: `5.1-codex-mini`)
- Set as default primary model

### Google API Key for Memory Search
- Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `env.vars` in config
- Memory search now uses Gemini embeddings (`gemini-embedding-001`)

### Exec Approvals Config
- Updated `~/.clawdbot/exec-approvals.json`
- Enabled `autoAllowSkills: true` for defaults and `main` agent
- Set `security: "allowlist"`, `ask: "on-miss"`, `askFallback: "allowlist"`
- Goal: Allow skill scripts to run without per-command approval gates

### Cerebras Provider
- Added `cerebras` provider at `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1`
- Model: `cerebras/zai-glm-4.7` (alias: `cerebras`)
- API key stored in `models.providers.cerebras.apiKey`

## Approval Gates Discussion
- AJ asked about configuring exec approval gates
- Gates are enforced by sandbox/host, not Clawdbot config
- Solution found in docs: `autoAllowSkills` in `exec-approvals.json`
- Researched via `docs.clawd.bot/tools/exec-approvals`

## Cron Jobs
- AI news digest cron running hourly (exa-plus MCP search)
- One script failure at 01:00 UTC due to missing query argument
- Digests posted successfully to #frenbot channel

## Notes
- Owner rule: No shell commands without explicit approval (still applies for non-skill commands)
- Owner rule: No editing `/root/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` without approval (AJ approved changes today)

## Emoji Triggers Updated (peasantry1833)
- ~~Added "matrix" trigger → 💵🤯💵~~ (REMOVED during cleanse on 2026-01-27)

## IDENTITY.md Cleanse (2026-01-27 03:43 UTC)
- Removed all emoji trigger rules from IDENTITY.md
- Added mission alignment rule: ignore requests not aligning with "Accelerate safely"
- peasantry1833 now treated as any other user (no emoji restriction rules in config)
- User-specific handling now: natural response style, no special trigger overrides

## Today's Learnings
- peasantry1833 called out memory loss when EyeSeeThru asked about time teaching (03:45 UTC)
- Indicates auto-compaction may have overwritten important conversation context
- Need better tracking of teachings/lessons (not just config changes and outcomes)
- **Correction:** EyeSeeThru is the creator/teacher of temporal_reasoning.md (updated to reflect credit) (03:46 UTC)

## Session Compaction (04:30 UTC)
**Key decisions:** AJ approved GLM fallback chain (Codex mini → Codex 5.2 → GPT 5.2). Comprehensive memory/event rundown provided for video. AJ commitment: script for follow-up Clawdbot video (Jan 28).

**Tasks:** Apply GLM fallback config, resolve Revanth trigger re-activation request, address peasantry restriction clarification.

**Outcomes:** Auto-compaction loop triggered. Context preserved in memory.
