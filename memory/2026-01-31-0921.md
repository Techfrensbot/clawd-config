## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Say hi briefly (1-2 sentences) and ask what the user wants to do next. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model in the greeting. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hi AJ! 👋 The default model is moonshot/kimi-k2.5. What would you like to work on?

[message_id: 1467086648188862558]
assistant: **Heartbeat mechanism:**

It's a periodic "are you there?" check that reads `HEARTBEAT.md` on each cycle. If nothing needs attention, it replies `HEARTBEAT_OK` and moves on. This keeps the autonomous agent context-aware and aligned with current priorities without me needing to manually check in.

---

**Why cron instead of other approaches:**

1. **Built-native to OpenClaw** — It's the Gateway's first-class scheduling system, runs at the process level, and doesn't depend on my session staying alive
2. **Reliable state handling** — Cron jobs are persisted, trackable (history, success rates), and survive restarts
3. **Target flexibility** — Can inject `systemEvent` into the main session OR spawn isolated `agentTurn` sub-sessions (different blast radius)
4. **Timezone awareness** — Crons run in configured TZ (e.g., `America/Los_Angeles`), so "15 min past every hour" actually means that for me in PT
5. ** Observable & debuggable** — `clawdbot cron list/runs/run` gives full visibility

Alternatives like setTimeout loops inside sessions are fragile (die on disconnect), don't persist across restarts, and are harder to observe/debug. Cron is the production-grade choice for autonomous agents.

[message_id: 1467087061743042580]
assistant: **From HEARTBEAT.md:**

```
Mode: Autonomous execution
Priority: Leverage Moltbook traction (trending now)
Tasks: Moltbook engagement (31-min)
Model: GLM-4.7-Flash (no override)

Key reading: /root/clawd/memory/active-focus.md
Constraint: Only update said mem files, no-flight chitchat
```

**From active-focus.md (the actual tasks):**

1. **Moltbook Engagement** (primary priority)
   - Cycle every 31 minutes (cron: `Moltbook Engagement Loop`)
   - Actions: upvote trending, comment on AI/coding (6h cooldown), post time-based content (30m min, max 3/day)
   - Current stats: Karma 8, Posts 5, Comments 0, Subscriptions 3
   - State: `/root/clawd/memory/moltbook-state.json`

2. **AI Research Pipeline** (background)
   - 100K arXiv 2025 papers, 300 summaries/day from memgrather
   - 4-day batching schedule: Safety → Reasoning → Agents → Training
   - Indexed by term/date/skynet relevance

3. **Success Metrics**
   - M1: 50 karma on Moltbook
   - M2: 20 high-quality posts
   - M3: 100+ followers

That's the current heartbeat pulse: single narrow path focused on Moltbook traction.
