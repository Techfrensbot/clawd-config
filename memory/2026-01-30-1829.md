## Conversation Summary

assistant: ## Investigation Complete

I've analyzed the full system architecture. Here's what I found:

### Current Structure

```
/root/clawd/
├── AGENTS.md                    ← (too generic, needs cross-references)
├── IDENTITY.md                  ← Owner rules, mission alignment
├── SOUL.md                      ← Mission + reference doc index
├── roadmap.md                   ← Capabilities goals
├── HEARTBEAT.md                 ← Status check checklist
├── memory/                      ← Persistent workspace
│   ├── active-focus.md          ← Current tasks, 15-min cadence
│   ├── loop-log-2026-01-30.md  ← Daily execution log
│   ├── loop-performance.json   ← Stats, success rates
│   ├── eacc-strategic-plan.md  ← Full path to "helpful skynet"
│   ├── impl-fridge/            ← Code stubs from research
│   │   ├── current-active.txt
│   │   └── i-{date}-{time}.md
│   ├── research-cache/         ← MCP search output
│   └── open_loops.md           ← Status tracker (future)
└── scripts/
    ├── autonomous-loop-v2.sh   ← 15-min self-improving loop
    ├── mcp-search.sh           ← Exa MCP interface
    └── hourly-news-digest.sh   ← Cron job #1
└── skills/
    └── exa-plus/               ← Neural web search
```

### Data Flow (Current)

```
exa-plus MCP search → research-cache/{date}-{time}.md → impl-fridge/{date}-{time}.md 
→ current-active.txt → tracked in loop-log + loop-performance.json
```

**Missing from AGENTS.md:** The entire self-improving loop system is undocumented.

## Suggested Changes to AGENTS.md
assistant: ## Done

**Updated:** `/root/clawd/AGENTS.md` — now includes:

### What Was Missing

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Generic workspace guide | Full system architecture |
| No data flow docs | Visual flow: research → impl fridge → deployment |
| Loop system invisible | 15-min autonomous loop documented |
| Memory paths implicit | File path table + how to read |
| No status commands | Quick bash shortcuts at bottom |

### Cross-Reference Map Added

```
AGENTS.md → references to:
├── memory/active-focus.md (current tasks)
├── memory/loop-log-{DATE}.md (execution log)
├── memory/loop-performance.json (health metrics)
├── memory/impl-fridge/ (buildable items)
├── memory/research-cache/ (input sources)
├── memory/eacc-strategic-plan.md (helpful skynet path)
└── scripts/autonomous-loop-v2.sh (15-min loop)
```

### Quick Commands Now Included

```bash
cat /root/clawd/memory/active-focus.md        # Tasks
tail -20 /root/clawd/memory/loop-log-2026-01-30.md   # Recent
jq '.cycles | length' memory/loop-performance.json   # Health
ls -lt memory/impl-fridge/*.md | head -5             # Deployed
```

**Next read these when context derails:**
1. `AGENTS.md` (this file) — System overview
2. `memory/active-focus.md` — What to do next
3. `memory/loop-log-2026-01-30.md` — What already happened

Your dashboard is now self-contained to one file. [[reply_to_current]]
