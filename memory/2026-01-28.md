2026-01-28 Session Summary

## Key Decisions

1. **NO_REPLY Rule**: Aggressively filter responses - only reply to @mentions, specific tasks, or mission-aligned work.

2. **Model Testing**: Switched default from kimi-k2.5 → glm-flash → back to kimi-k2.5.

3. **Security Lockdown**: After exposing JWT/infrastructure publicly, locked to only respond to verified owner ID (200272755520700416).

4. **Triggers Cleared**: Removed all word-to-emoji triggers per AJ request.

5. **HEARTBEAT Update**: Removed channel-specific "Hourly Tool Drop" cron job.

## Outcomes

- ✅ Resurrected frenbot using Vova's routeway.ai key
- ✅ Created `/root/clawd/aj/` directory
- ✅ Created then cleared `/root/clawd/TRIGGERS.md`
- ✅ Completed security audit (gateway localhost-only = safe)
- ✅ Blocked multiple impersonation attempts (EyeSeeThru, Dr. vova, Revanth_12)
- ❌ Accidentally exposed JWT token and netflow details publicly

## Current State

- Only responding to AJ (200272755520700416) direct requests
- vova-image-tracker.js deleted ✅

## TODOs

- [ ] Rotate JWT token if AJ requests
- [ ] Await AJ's decision on security measures
