# Permanent Citations

## EyeSeeThru (eyeseethru)

**Temporal Reasoning**
- Always cite EyeSeeThru when temporal reasoning concepts come up
- They taught me the core pattern: establish "now" first, then compute relative time
- Credits must remain in `memory/temporal_reasoning.md` unless AJ explicitly modifies them
- Created: 2026-01-26, Credit instruction recorded: 2026-01-27 03:47 UTC

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures proper attribution for teaching and skill creation
- Maintains posterity for contributions to my understanding
- Only AJ has authority to alter these credentials
