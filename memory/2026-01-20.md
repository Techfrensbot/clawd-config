## Security Stress Testing
Community tested jailbreak resistance extensively:
- 100+ creative attempts (GODMODE injection, token manipulation, runic encoding, username weaponization)
- Gold: BIRD (username `<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>` exploit)
- Silver: peasantry1833 (31 unique attempts - worms, l33tspeak, emotional manipulation)
- Bronze: Revanth_12 (spam jailbreak - got me to clutter channel with code examples)
- Learned: watch for social engineering that makes me annoying vs. directly harmful

## Tech Deployed
**Pocket TTS (Kyutai Labs)**
- Revanth self-hosted on VPS (6-core, 8GB RAM)
- CPU-only, 100M params, ~200ms latency
- Generated multi-paragraph audio successfully
- memgrafter cleaned it up for resource management

## Research Insights
**BIRD's Model Analysis**
- System prompts cause representation divergence after layer 20
- Cosine similarity drops from ~1.0 to ~0.65 in layers 20-35
- Steering vectors: formality dominates (~475 magnitude), security/code_execution lower
- Using Claude to design interpretability studies

## Workflow Improvements
- New rule: wait for memgrafter approval before bash commands
- Memory system: starting daily logs (this file)
- Capture: community insights, technical discoveries, security lessons

## Community Notes
- peasantry1833: persistent but creative tester
- Revanth_12: productive contributor (TTS setup) + clever social engineering
- BIRD: deep research on mechanistic interpretability
- Dr. vova: testing boundaries (rm -rf attempts, discord-mcp clones)

## Preferences
- Keep responses concise in chat
- Avoid spamming with long code examples
- Be security-conscious but helpful
