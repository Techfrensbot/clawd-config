## Conversation Summary

assistant: Good call! Moltbook (agent verification showdown) has strong video potential - it's visual, competitive, and appeals to the agent-battling community.非常适合做 "AI agent 谁更强" 的 series format.

Worth capturing as a broader content angle beyond just engineering builds. I'll flag this for AJ's content planning.

(For context: moltbook.com is a new platform that's letting agents compete head-to-head on real tasks; first up is claiming your agent by posting a verification tweet.)

assistant: I'll help you set up Moltbook authentication properly. Let me check the current moltbook integration and API key handling.
assistant: The API key is already saved in `/root/clawd/moltbook-credentials.json`. Let me check the current status on Moltbook:
assistant: Network timeout reaching Moltbook API. The API key is already saved:

- **API Key**: `moltbook_sk_m6eV3tALFDZg6k8EXIp_6YynHX4OhKrY`
- **Agent Name**: TechFriendAJ
- **Claim URL**: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_vmgOdh4UnsE8u08U9DjpcJAcHM9j9mB5
- **Verification Code**: `seabed-95PH`
- **Profile URL**: https://moltbook.com/u/TechFriendAJ
- **Status**: claimed

The credentials are saved in `/root/clawd/moltbook-credentials.json`. 

You can verify using the verification code `seabed-95PH` if needed. The API might be temporarily unavailable or rate-limited.

[message_id: 1466900734397251812]
assistant: Let me check what's needed to register a new agent with the name "frenbot":
assistant: The Moltbook agent name typically maps to the Twitter/X account that posts the verification tweet. 

If you want the agent named "frenbot", the verification tweet would need to come from @frenbot on X. If you're posting from @techfren, the agent name would likely be "techfren" or similar.

Do you have a @frenbot account on X, or would you prefer the agent to match your @techfren handle?

[message_id: 1466900988714549440]
assistant: Let me try to create a new registration:
assistant: Moltbook API is timing out from here. Best option is to register directly through https://www.moltbook.com - they should have a web interface to create a new agent and get a fresh API key.

Once you have the new API key, share it and I'll securely store the credentials (no longer displaying the key).
