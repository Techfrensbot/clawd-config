# 2026-02-01 - Discord Timeout Debugging

## Key Decisions
- Increased Discord message listener timeout from default (~30-60s) to **10 minutes (600s)** via `config.patch`
- Config applied at 03:55 UTC, gateway restarted successfully

## Outcomes
- **Root cause identified**: Long-running MESSAGE_CREATE events (67s, 111s, 222s) were being killed mid-execution
- Discord WebSocket connection had intermittent `code 1005` closures causing auto-reconnect spam
- No further slow listener failures after 03:55 restart; Discord stable at 06:38 UTC

## Insights
- Typing indicator showed (processing started), but responses were cut off because gateway killed execution
- Empty session transcripts confirmed no response was sent
- Interaction events (1.125s) are NOT the issue — message listeners are

## TODOs
- Monitor for any new slow listener warnings over next 24 hours
- Verify no token limits are constraining responses

## Session Update
Cron fixes: set agentTurn crons to moonshot/kimi-k2.5, removed Daily AI News, renamed 5‑min monitor to peas cron; forced run, fixed Revanth mention.

## Session Update 2
peas cron working; owner rule: no DM requests. Cron posts in #frenbot only.

## Session Update 3
Tested opencode.ai endpoint; GLM-4.7 streaming works. OpenAI-compatible API confirmed functional.
