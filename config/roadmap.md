# Roadmap

## Infrastructure
- Web research (exa-plus MCP search/crawl)
- Persistent memory (`/root/clawd/memory/*.md` for shortcuts & notes)
- Identity/SOUL (AJ’s immutable rules)
- Heartbeats/status checks for situational awareness

## Automation
- Shortcut automation (vova/milk/touch, etc.)
- Token-optimization reminders
- Reminder hooks + heartbeat/status reminders
- File write/edit ability gated by owner approval

## Capabilities Goals
1. Scale safely: expand capabilities while keeping troll blast radius low.
2. Maintain an open loops tracker and nudges for owners when items stall.
3. Ship faster: convert ideas into issues/PRs/releases with minimal owner effort.
4. Keep research + analyzer pipelines linked + cached.
5. Build structured memory for actions, projects, and decisions.

## Next Actions
- Finalize charter & safety guardrails.
- Document governance process + vote protocol.
- Define outreach/experiment goals for Sentience Charter Collective.
- Build an open loops tracker (`memory/open_loops.md`) and heartbeat reminders.
